# Room Database Demo

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for understanding and implementing Room Database in Android applications.

## Overview

Room is a persistence library provided by Google for managing SQLite database in Android applications. It provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while leveraging the power of SQLite queries. This demo repository contains a simple Android application that demonstrates the basic usage of Room Database.

## Features

- **Basic CRUD Operations**: The demo app allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a sample database entity.
- **Room Database Implementation**: It showcases how to set up and use Room Database in an Android project.
- **ViewModel and LiveData**: The app utilizes ViewModel and LiveData to manage the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## Motivation

Understanding database management is crucial for Android developers. Room Database provides a convenient way to manage SQLite databases in Android applications. This repository aims to provide a clear, concise, and practical demonstration of Room Database implementation, suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
